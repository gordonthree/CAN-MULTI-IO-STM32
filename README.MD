# Multi-IO Node
* STM32L433 Microcontroller
* 3-pin terminal block for CANBUS connection with drain
* Jumper selected CAN terminator resistor
* Pin-header connections for IO modules
* LED indicator for 3.3v power
* LED indicator for status, controlled by the micro
* Bidirectional transient voltage protection diode for harsh environments
* Debugging header for UART1 serial port as well as SWLINK programming
